INTRODUCTION
------------

The General Data Protection Regulation module gives end user visibility to the
data stored about themself and aims to help site admins follow the guidelines
and legislation set by the EU.

Please note:
Installing and using this module pack does not mean the site becomes GDPR
compliant. GDPR affects the whole organisation, this module aims to help to
understand its Drupal relations and tries to provide helper tools to make the
site GDPR compliant.
